# Dyn Vision Doc

This is an attempt to catalog some of the usability challenges around `dyn` in Rust and to brainstorm solutions.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open PRs that either:

* Add status quo stories! Tell about the kinds of frustrating tangles that can arise when using `dyn` (and the things that work great).
* Add shiny future stories! Tell about interesting design ideas. The more the merrier.
